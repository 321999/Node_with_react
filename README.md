## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)

addign everything whatever is required to perform the task


ot push our code we had followed some steps along with the one utube video
```
remote: Permission to 321999/Node_with_react.git denied to 321999.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/321999/Node_with_react.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

so the answer for this errro is 
u have to first set yur user name and the gmail
# git config user.email  ""
# git config user.name
then 
# git config credential user.name 
copy this rser name from git hub url 
# know push ur code and hit enter 
* it will ask u for the password 
* so for password generate the permission link called token 
and paste that token as a password
